# Project2-TheDeals

<p>The Deals App is programed by the Groupon API that finds yout local goods, food and travel based on location and choices during set up. On the home page we have two carousels one is populating related images and the one underneath is shuffling between cards in the deals of the day. Then for the Coupons near me we added a location button where you have the option to change your location if your traveling and will populated coupons underneath. </p>

<p>Moreover, we created a sign-up page as a mode of expediting the search process for people who visit our app. During the process of signing up (creating an account), visitors will be asked about their preferred location (metropolitan area), and which categories of coupons appeal to them the most. The three categories provided; Travel, Goods, and Local; all yield subcateogies when the visitor hovers over a particular one. By utilizing the popover function, we facilitate the process of choosing a category or categories, that the visitor feels most enthusiastic about. By doing this, our app is able to ensure the coupons that appear, are tailored not only to the location of the user, but also to their primary interests. </p>
